## Workflow's Used and Develop time ✴

| System | Problem Description | Workflow Description | Time Used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Re-connection + Memory | 💾 Lack of native history context saving. | ⚙️ Implemented a function to save and retrieve history context using model instructions. | 15 Days, 30 Hours |
| UI | 🖥️ Electron UI incompatible with current backend. TkInter and PyQt were too basic. | 🎨 Developed an attractive CMD ASCII UI using Colorama. | 5 Days, 7 Hours |
| Modularization | 🧱 2700 Lines of code, that make the coding IMPOSSIBLE. | 📂 Finnaly, i decided modularize the code, with an advanced structure of folders and stuff, it was so hard, I litteraly re-make all the code by zero | 10 Days, 27 Hours |
| Language Code | 🗣️ It was a hearth hurt that the voice didnt sound good in spanish, and when I finnaly got the API implement, A lot of pydantic errors | 🐛 I solve it, by found an error with the class name deprected to discard, soon. I was using it so i can't pass the parameter language_code "" finnaly i solved it | 10 Days, 11 Hours |
